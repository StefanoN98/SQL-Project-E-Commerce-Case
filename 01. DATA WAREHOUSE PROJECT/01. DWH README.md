# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server**, implementing robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to handle structured data from CSV sources. The architecture follows the **Medallion approach** (**Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**) to ensure data is efficiently ingested, cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analytical consumption.

## 🏗 Data Architecture

The project adheres to the **Medallion Architecture**, which consists of three layers:

## 🟤 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- 📂 Stores **raw data** as received from source systems (**CRM, ERP**) in **CSV format**.
- ❌ No transformation is applied.
- ⚙ Data is loaded using **batch processing** with **full load** and **truncate & insert strategies** (stored procedures).
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables

## Actions & Structure
In this layer we create 3 queries:
1.  **DDL Query** which defines and creates all required tables using a *Drop & Create* approach to ensure a clean structure on each run.
    
2.  **Bulk Insert Query** where we load the data with a *Truncate & Inser*t method. The script, for some tables, leverages WIDECHAR and UNICODE encoding to correctly handle foreign and special characters.
   
3.  **Stored Procedure** which automates the data loading process in a single execution. It includes basic error handling and execution time logging for each table to facilitate monitoring and debugging.

## ⚪ 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned, Standardized Data)
- 🧹 Cleanses and **standardizes raw data** for **consistency and quality**.
- 🔍 Performs **data cleansing, normalization, derived columns, and enrichment**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables


## Actions & Structure
#### In the Silver Layer, we performed extensive data transformations and validations to ensure data quality, consistency, and compliance with business rules. Key operations include:

- Detection and removal of duplicates and `NULL` values  
- Identification and handling of empty strings and unwanted characters  
- Validation of logical consistency across datasets  
- Derivation of new columns based on business logic  
- Enforcement of business rules and data constraints  
- Referential integrity verification  
- Management and correction of special and non-standard characters  
- Application of data standardization processes
- Create a customized function with T-SQL

#### To implement these transformations, we leveraged a variety of SQL functions and features, including:

- **String Functions:** `TRIM`, `LEN`, `LEFT`, `LIKE`, `SUBSTRING`, `REPLACE`  
- **Date Functions:** `ISDATE`, `DATEADD`  
- **Null Handling Functions:** `IS NULL`, `NULLIF`, `COALESCE`  
- **Data Type Conversion:** `CAST`, `TRY_CONVERT`  
- **Aggregate Functions:** `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`  
- Control flow with **CASE WHEN** expressions  
- Use of **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** and **Subqueries** for modular and readable queries  
- **Window functions** such as `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK` for advanced ranking and partitioning  
- Data modification with `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements  
- Advanced transformations using `PIVOT`, `TRANSLATE`, and `STRING_AGG`

## 🟡 3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- 💡 Provides **transformed data** optimized for **analytics and reporting**.
- 🔄 Applies **data integration, aggregation, and business logic**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Views 
- 🌟 Implements **Star Schema model**.
