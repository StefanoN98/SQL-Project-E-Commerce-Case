# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server**, implementing robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to handle structured data from CSV sources. The architecture follows the **Medallion approach** (**Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**) to ensure data is efficiently ingested, cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analytical consumption.
