# 📊 SQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📝 Overview

This project focuses on building a **Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL Server**, implementing robust **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** processes to handle structured data from CSV sources. The architecture follows the **Medallion approach** (**Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers**) to ensure data is efficiently ingested, cleaned, transformed, and optimized for analytical consumption.

## 🏗 Data Architecture

The project adheres to the **Medallion Architecture**, which consists of three layers:

## 🟤 1. Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- 📂 Stores **raw data** as received from source systems (**CRM, ERP**) in **CSV format**.
- ❌ No transformation is applied.
- ⚙ Data is loaded using **batch processing** with **full load** and **truncate & insert strategies** (stored procedures).
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables

## Actions & Structure
In this layer we create 3 queries:
1.  **DDL Query** which defines and creates all required tables using a *Drop & Create* approach to ensure a clean structure on each run.
    
2.  **Bulk Insert Query** where we load the data with a *Truncate & Inser*t method. The script, for some tables, leverages WIDECHAR and UNICODE encoding to correctly handle foreign and special characters.
   
3.  **Stored Procedure** which automates the data loading process in a single execution. It includes basic error handling and execution time logging for each table to facilitate monitoring and debugging.

## ⚪ 2. Silver Layer (Cleaned, Standardized Data)
- 🧹 Cleanses and **standardizes raw data** for **consistency and quality**.
- 🔍 Performs **data cleansing, normalization, derived columns, and enrichment**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Tables

## 🟡 3. Gold Layer (Business-Ready Data)
- 💡 Provides **transformed data** optimized for **analytics and reporting**.
- 🔄 Applies **data integration, aggregation, and business logic**.
- 📌 **Object Type**: Views 
- 🌟 Implements **Star Schema model**.
