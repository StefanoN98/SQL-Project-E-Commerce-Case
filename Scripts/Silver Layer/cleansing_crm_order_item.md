# üßπ Data Cleansing: `crm_order_items` (Bronze Layer)

> This script performs data quality checks and cleansing operations on the `bronze.crm_order_items` table before promoting the data to the **Silver Layer**.  
> The goal is to ensure that all records are complete, clean, and logically consistent prior to transformation and standardization.

## ‚úÖ Checks Summary

| Category              | Check Description                                           |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness          | Check for NULL values                                       |
| Numeric range         | Ensure `price` and `freight_value` are non-negative         |
| Trimmed strings       | Remove unwanted spaces from text fields                     |
| ID length             | Validate that `order_id` has exactly 32 characters          |
| Composite key         | Check for duplicates on `(order_id, order_item_id)`         |
| Item sequence         | Ensure item numbers are sequential within each `order_id`   |
| Empty strings         | Detect empty string values in key fields                    |
| Date validity         | Ensure shipping date is within reasonable date range        |
| Logical consistency   | Detect `price = 0` with positive `freight_value`            |
| Business logic        | Derive `shipping_type` from `freight_value`                 |

SELECT *
FROM bronze.crm_order_items
WHERE TRIM(order_id) != order_id OR
      TRIM(product_id) != product_id OR

-- No anomalies detected
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Section: Data Integrity

```sql
-- Negative values
SELECT *
FROM bronze.crm_order_items
WHERE price < 0 OR freight_value < 0;

-- Zero price but positive freight
SELECT *
FROM bronze.crm_order_items
WHERE price = 0 AND freight_value > 0;
```

---

## üöö Section: Shipping Type Derivation

```sql
SELECT *,
    CASE 
        WHEN freight_value > 0 THEN 'Standard Shipping'
        ELSE 'Free Shipping'
    END AS shipping_type
FROM bronze.crm_order_items;
```
