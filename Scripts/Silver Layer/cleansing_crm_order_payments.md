## Check for Duplicates (`order_id`, `payment_sequential`)

```sql
SELECT order_id + '_' + CAST(payment_sequential AS nvarchar(5)) AS composite_key,
       COUNT(*)
FROM BRONZE.crm_order_payments
GROUP BY order_id + '_' + CAST(payment_sequential AS nvarchar(5))
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- No duplicates detected
```
---

## Check Distinct Payment Types

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT payment_type
FROM BRONZE.crm_order_payments;
-- No anomalies detected in payment types
```
---

## Check for Zero or NULL Payments
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM BRONZE.crm_order_payments
WHERE payment_value <= 0 OR payment_value IS NULL;
/* There are payments equal to zero where the transaction failed,
 these payments belong to the "not_defined" type and will be excluded */
```
---

## Check Payment Value Range
```sql
SELECT 
       MIN(payment_value) AS min_payment,
       MAX(payment_value) AS max_payment
FROM BRONZE.crm_order_payments;
-- Ensure all payments have a valid payment value
```
